#Create a function called count_the_vowels. 
# The function takes one argument, a string, and returns the number of vowels in the string. 
#For example ‘hello’ should return 2 vowels. If a vowel appears in a string more than once it should be counted as one. 
#For example,‘saas’ should return 1 vowel. Your code should count lowercase and uppercase vowels.

        if char.lower() in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
print(count_the_vowels("hello")) #2
