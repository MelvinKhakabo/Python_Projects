#Write a function called password_validator. The function asks the user to enter a password. A valid password should have at least one 
#upper letter, one lower letter, and one number. It should not be less than 8 characters long. When the user enters a password, the 
#function should check if the password is valid. If the password is valid, the function should return the valid password. If the password 
#is not valid, the function should tell the users the errors in the password and prompt the user to enter another password. The 
#code should only stop once the user enters a valid password. (use while loop).
