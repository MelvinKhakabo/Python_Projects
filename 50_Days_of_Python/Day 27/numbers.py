#Write a function called unique_numbers that takes a list of numbers
#as an argument. Your function is going to find all the unique numbers 
#in the list. It will then sum up the unique numbers. You will calculate 
#the difference between the sum of all the numbers in the original 
#list and the sum of unique numbers in the list. If the difference is 
#an even number, your function should return the original list. If the 
#difference is an odd number, your function should return a list with 
#unique numbers only. For example [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8] should 
#return [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8].

def unique_numbers(numbers):
    unique = list(set(numbers))
    sum_numbers = sum(numbers)
    sum_unique = sum(unique)
    difference = sum_numbers - sum_unique
    if difference % 2 == 0:
        return numbers
    else:
        return unique

print(unique_numbers([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8])) #[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8]
