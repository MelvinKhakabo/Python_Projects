# Molecular Motion Concept
The path of a pollen grain or molecule can be simulated using a random walk, where each step corresponds to random movement in 2D space.
We'll start the particle at (0, 0), and at each step, it will move randomly in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right) by a unit step.
To make the movement more "realistic", the number of points will be limited to 5000 steps, which simulates a reasonable level of diffusion.

## Using plt.plot()
Unlike plt.scatter(), plt.plot() will create a continuous path, which is ideal for showing how the pollen grain moves along its path over time.
We will track the particleâ€™s x and y positions and plot them in a 2D space.

## Cleaning the Axes
To create a cleaner visualization, we can hide the axes using plt.gca().get_xaxis().set_visible(False) and plt.gca().get_yaxis().set_visible(False).

# Explanation of the Code
## molecular_motion() Function
This function simulates the random walk of the pollen grain (or any molecule).
It starts at (0, 0) and generates a list of x_values and y_values by randomly choosing one of the four possible directions at each step:
Up: Increase the y value by 1.
Down: Decrease the y value by 1.
Left: Decrease the x value by 1.
Right: Increase the x value by 1.
The number of points (num_points) defaults to 5000 to simulate the movement, which can be adjusted based on the simulation needs.

## Plotting
plt.plot(x_values, y_values, linewidth=1) is used to plot the path of the molecule with a continuous line. The linewidth=1 ensures the path isn't too thick but still clearly visible.
plt.gca().get_xaxis().set_visible(False) and plt.gca().get_yaxis().set_visible(False) remove the axes for a cleaner visualization of the motion.
plt.show() displays the plot, allowing you to see how the molecule moved after 5000 steps.

## Main Function
The main() function handles the simulation and plotting. When the script is executed, it runs the molecular_motion() function and plots the resulting path.
### Running the Code
When you run this code, you will see a plot showing a random path of a molecule (simulated pollen grain) over 5000 steps, with a continuous line representing the path it took.
### Key Points
Random Movement: The molecule moves randomly at each step in one of four possible directions, which is a basic form of a random walk.
Plotting the Path: plt.plot() is used instead of plt.scatter(), which connects the points and simulates a continuous path.
Axes Hidden: The axes are hidden for a cleaner view of the path itself, making the plot visually more similar to how molecular motion would look in a confined space.
### Adjustments
Increasing or Decreasing Steps: If you want to simulate more or fewer steps, simply adjust the num_points argument when calling molecular_motion().
Line Width: You can change linewidth=1 to a larger number to make the path line thicker or thinner depending on your preferences.
